The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) is a fundamental concept in software design and object-oriented programming. It states that a class should have only one reason to change, or in other words, a class should have only one well-defined responsibility.

In simpler terms, SRP suggests that a class should encapsulate a single piece of functionality or a single concern. This ensures that each class is focused on a specific task and doesn't become overly complex by trying to handle multiple unrelated responsibilities.

By adhering to SRP, developers create code that is more modular, maintainable, and flexible. When changes are required, they are localized to specific classes, reducing the risk of unintended side effects and making the code easier to test and understand.

In essence, SRP promotes a clean and organized codebase by encouraging the division of responsibilities among different classes, ultimately contributing to more efficient and sustainable software development.
